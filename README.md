# Colour Name Explorer

## ⌨️ Tech stack
React / CSS / Typescript / Vite

## 🍼 Introduction
After learning some React advanced concepts, I wanted to practice using the useDeferredValue hook including implementing suspense-related concepts. Therefore I created the Colour Names Explorer. Users can explore odd and surprising names given to colours as they filter for them in real-time.

## 🛠️ Features
- Loading page to show the whole colour list is loading in
- Filter colours by name and see results live.
- Decreased opacity to show when results are changing + become stale
- Colour name has the colour shade associated with it
- Responsive design - works on mobile + desktop
- Able to click/tap on a colour and see its colour code (RGB and HSL) within a modal
